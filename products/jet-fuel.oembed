{"product_id":"jet-fuel","title":"Jet Fuel","description":"\u003cp\u003eWe’re taking to the air, creating the future of our commercial goods and regenerating the aviation industry. We’re introducing one of the first aviation fuels made from CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c\/sub\u003e, powering air travel with air itself. Sustainable aviation fuel plays an integral role in reducing the carbon footprint of traditional fuels significantly, and by 2050, all airlines will have to transition to 100% sustainable fuel. We’re emerging as a pioneer in this space, creating a carbon-neutral jet fuel to be distributed across North America. To curb our emissions stemming from transport, we’ll deploy modular sites as close to airports as possible, creating a direct facility-to-airport pipeline.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Air Company","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":41032005615777,"sku":"","price":40.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"url":"https:\/\/aircompany.com\/products\/jet-fuel","provider":"Air Company","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
