{"product_id":"rocket-fuel","title":"Rocket Fuel","description":"\u003cp\u003eOur proprietary technology has the ability to transform carbon dioxide (CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c\/sub\u003e), from both the atmosphere on Mars and from the air on earth, into rocket fuel. The atmosphere of Mars is primarily comprised of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c\/sub\u003e (95.32%)—the remainder being N2 (2.5%) and Ar (1.9%)—providing us the perfect opportunity to plant our technology on its surface to propel the ongoing production of fuel. Our team of engineers is continuously innovating our rocket fuel so that we can bring astronauts home from Mars.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Air Company","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":41032018985121,"sku":"","price":40.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"url":"https:\/\/aircompany.com\/products\/rocket-fuel","provider":"Air Company","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
