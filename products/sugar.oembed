{"product_id":"sugar","title":"Sugar","description":"\u003cp\u003eOn our trajectory towards commercialization, we have identified a way to create consumable sugar (glucose) using our patented carbon conversion technology. This carbon-negative sugar can be used for human consumption or as a microbe for biomanufacturing products such as food and plastic. Our sugar creation is supported by NASA as we work together to extend humanity by creating microbes that can be used during space expeditions to Mars. While we have developed sugar for applications beyond earth, we are also actively working to assess viable means to scale its production here on our planet as well.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Air Company","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":41032021770401,"sku":"","price":40.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"url":"https:\/\/aircompany.com\/products\/sugar","provider":"Air Company","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
